        Thank you for showing interest, here is a quick story of me and this website. My programming journey started back in 2023, 
        two years before I started studying NEET in CCT Academy.
        I am currently in my second year Diploma and doing Internship in Full Stack Web Development course at Edubenchers under my Senior Head.
         I like coding all kind of problems from the very basic like adding numbers to the complex ones like competitive programming problems. 
         I love making projects and games. Infact this website is one of my Web Development Projects which is built using HTML and CSS.

        Languages known : C Language, C++,C#, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, MySQL.
        IT Constructs : Data Structures and Algorithm, OOP, HTML, CSS, LINUX, and Git & GitHub.
